# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains the 3D model files (GLB format) used throughout the Aranyas website.

## 📁 Required Files

Place your GLB model files here with these **exact names**:

```
public/models/
├── biodegradable-bag.glb          ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
├── sugarcane-stalk.glb
├── printing-press.glb
├── bioplastic-pellets.glb
├── extrusion-machine.glb
└── injection-machine.glb
```

## ✅ Current Status

- [ ] biodegradable-bag.glb
- [ ] sugarcane-stalk.glb
- [ ] printing-press.glb
- [ ] bioplastic-pellets.glb
- [ ] extrusion-machine.glb
- [ ] injection-machine.glb

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Place GLB files** in this directory with exact names above
2. **Run the website** - models will automatically load
3. **If files missing** - placeholders will show (no errors)
