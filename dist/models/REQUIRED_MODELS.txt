REQUIRED 3D MODEL FILES
========================

Place your GLB model files in this directory with these EXACT names:

1. biodegradable-bag.glb          (HIGHEST PRIORITY - Hero section)
2. sugarcane-stalk.glb            (Background element)
3. printing-press.glb             (Custom printing showcase)
4. bioplastic-pellets.glb         (Raw materials section)
5. extrusion-machine.glb          (Factory environment)
6. injection-machine.glb          (Factory environment)

FILE REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: GLB (single file, not GLTF with external files)
- Size: < 5MB per file (optimize if larger)
- Textures: PBR 4K (base color, metalness, roughness, normal, alpha)
- Background: Transparent (alpha channel)

Once you place the files here, they will automatically load in the website.
No code changes needed!

See 3D_MODEL_GUIDE.md for detailed specifications.
